To use the windows bot, follow these steps:
1. Download the zip file by clicking "View Raw" after clicking on the file
2. Extract the zip file to any folder you please
3. Click on the folder and, inside that folder, there are two key files:config and supremebotv2

The config files contains all the necessary info that is needed to successfully run the bot. This info includes: your personal "key" and "secret" and the path to your chrome profile.

To successfully run this bot, you will need to obtain a "key" and "secret" by either emailing grandstreetsupreme@gmail.com; or messaging /u/grandstreetsupreme on Reddit. The current rate for a "key" and "secret" is $25. The season the "key" and "secret" cost something at all, is because most of the money goes towards the captcha solving service we use. 

Furthermore, this bot uses your default chrome profile(the path to which can be obtained by typing chrome://version into the url bar of google chrome and copyin the Profile Path) and, as such, it is expected that you have all of your checkout information autofilled on the checkout page of Supreme's website. 

Once you have your key, path and secret, you can simply paste them into the appropriate places in the config file.

To run the bot, simply double click on "suprembotv2" in the windowsbot folder. 

If you have any questions about installation, how the bot works, or how successful it is, please contact me via email or Reddit(as explained above)
