To use the windows bot, follow these steps:
1. Download the zip file by clicking "View Raw" after clicking on the zip file above
2. Extract the zip file to any folder you please
3. Click on the folder and, inside that folder, there are two key files:config and supremebotv2

The config files contains all the necessary info that is needed to successfully run the bot. This info includes: your personal "key" and "secret" and the path to your chrome profile.

To successfully run this bot, you will need to obtain a "key" and "secret" by either emailing grandstreetsupreme@gmail.com; or messaging /u/grandstreetsupreme on Reddit. The current rate for a "key" and "secret" is $25. No other bot on the market currently has a countodown timer, an automatic start, captcha token harvesting, captcha solving, 3+ items per order, select item and size, key word search and different modes for under $50. 

Furthermore, this bot uses your default chrome profile(the path to which can be obtained by typing chrome://version into the url bar of google chrome and copying the Profile Path) and, as such, it is expected that you have all of your checkout information autofilled on the checkout page of Supreme's website. 

Once you have your key, path and secret, you can simply paste them into the appropriate places in the config file.

To run the bot, simply double click on "suprembotv2" in the windows bot folder.

If you would like to use our software and you do not use Windows but instead use an os such as Mac or Linux, please email grandstreetsupreme@gmail.com or message /u/grandstreetsupreme on Reddit. For mac or Linux, we have to compile a .app version of the bot specifically designed for you on our server as one cannot edit the config.py file after the .app aplication is made(unlike what you can do with .exe applications). After we make a specialized version of the bot for you, you will be sent the bot in zip format via email.

If you have any questions about installation, how the bot works, or how successful it is, please contact me via email or Reddit(as explained above)
